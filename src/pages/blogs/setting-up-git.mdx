# What is [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) ?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. [[ref](https://git-scm.com/)]

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in software development.

# Setup `git`

- If you haven't installed git yet on your machine, you can download it from the official website [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and make sure to follow the installation instructions for your own operating system.

  ```
  https://git-scm.com/downloads
  ```

  _Git usually comes pre-installed on some Linux operating systems._

- Setup your identity. The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

  ```sh
  git config --global user.name "My Name"
  git config --global user.email "myemail@mail.com"
  ```

  _You can ommit the `--global` if you want to use a different identity in a different repository._

# Setup SSH Keys for Authentication

- Open terminal and paste and run the following command

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-github-or-gitlab-email@mail.com"
  ```

  - Follow the instructions accordingly:

    ![ssh keygen](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/ssh-keygen.png)

    The key should be available in `/home/your-username/.ssh/[keyname].pub` (it depends on how you set it)

- Add the SSH key to `ssh-agent`

  - Start the `ssh-agent` in the background.

    ```sh
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    # Output:
    # Agent pid [random number]
    ```

  - Add you ssh key to `ssh-agent`
    ```sh
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # replace id_ed25519 with the name you set
    ```

- Copy the contents of your pub key

  ```sh
  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # replace id_ed25519 with the name you set

  # Output:
  # ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAC0gTjpr1XOA4OB1iK7rCL/3p1gDQu47bDEXRY8ysng your-email@gmail.com
  ```

- Add SSH Keys to your account

<GitTabs>

<Fragment slot="github">

- Go to your `Settings` > `SSH & GPG Keys` > `New SSH Key`

  ![github add ssh](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-ssh.png)

- Add your key

  ![github add ssh key](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-ssh-key.png)

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="gitlab">

- Click on your profile icon > `Preferences` > `SSH Keys`

  ![gitlab add ssh](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gitlab-add-ssh.png)

- Add your key

  > _You can set an expiration key when adding ssh keys (though I don't recommend doing so as it is a hassle repeating the process once expired)_

# Authentication

Before logging in to your account, make sure to setup your git settings to save login details / credentials by running the following command:

```sh
git config --global credential.helper store
```

The best way to start with authenticating with your GitHub / GitLab accounts with git is by creating a repository. Let's start...

<GitTabs>

<Fragment slot="github">

- Start by creating a new repository ([`https://github.com/new`](https://github.com/new))

  ![github show new repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-repo-0.png)

- Add a project name (required) and description (not required)

  ![github add new repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-repo-1.png)

- Copy the SSH url of your repository

  ![github copy ssh repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-repo-2.png)

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="gitlab">

- Start by creating a new repository ([`https://gitlab.com/projects/new`](https://gitlab.com/projects/new))

  ![gitlab show new repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gitlab-add-repo-0.png)

- Add a project name (required)

  ![gitlab add new repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gitlab-add-repo-1.png)

- Copy the SSH url of your repository

  ![gitlab copy ssh repo](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gitlab-add-repo-2.png)

</Fragment>

</GitTabs>

- Copy the SSH url of your repository.

  Example: `git@github.com:tbdsux/my-awesome-project.git`

- Clone your project

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:tbdsux/my-awesome-project.git
  ```

  You should be prompted with the following upon first setup.

  ![git ssh first setup](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/auth-first-ssh.png)

# `Verified` commits with GPG Keys

You can also get <b>Verified</b> with git not only on social media platforms :)

You can sign commits and tags you make for your repository. When you add a cryptographic signature to your commit, you provide extra assurance that a commit originated from you, rather than an impersonator.

- Download and Install the [GPG command line tools](https://www.gnupg.org/download/)

  _It usually comes pre-installed on some Linux OS distributions._

- Open your Terminal

- Generate a GPG key pair by running the command

  ```sh
  gpg --full-generate-key
  ```

  When prompted:

  - Select `RSA and RSA`
  - `4096`
  - Set expiration for the key (`0` for not expiring)
  - Add you real name and email address you setup on your Github and Gitlab account with your git
  - You will also be required to add a passphrase _(You can also not have a passphrase)_

  ![gpg gen key](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gpg-gen-key.png)

- List the keys you have

  ```sh
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

  # gpg: checking the trustdb
  # gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
  # gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u
  # /home/tbdsux/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
  # ------------------------------------
  # sec   rsa4096/EDFE9DC0563BE2CF 2023-05-30 [SC]
  #     AA835920249E1BA193089984EDFE9DC0563BE2CF
  # uid                 [ultimate] Joshue Abance <iamcoderx@gmail.com>
  # ssb   rsa4096/D0E7E7BEBB888F52 2023-05-30 [E]
  ```

- Show the public key. We will need this to add to our Github / Gitlab account.

  ```
  gpg --armor --export <ID> # replace the ID with the ID shown above, ex: EDFE9DC0563BE2CF
  ```

- Copy your GPG Key, from `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` to `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`

  Example:

  ```sh
  -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

  mQINBGR1w1cBEADREMufVqZIwDohii1+imy5zwMx1ldWdOwlunb9eE2cZzbhzq6g
  ...
  CVxc2bBZp30LcbfVC+nZV02g56S8ci8nuSVfr/Ne4kMRwDs2l9O2S8WuaaJJfhA=
  =eJHe
  -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
  ```

- Add the keys to your accounts

<GitTabs>

<Fragment slot="github">

- Go to your `Settings` > `SSH & GPG Keys` > `New GPG Key` ([`https://github.com/settings/gpg/new`](https://github.com/settings/gpg/new))

- Add your key

  ![github add gpg key](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/github-add-gpg.png)

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="gitlab">

- Click on your profile icon > `Preferences` > `GPG Keys` ([`https://gitlab.com/-/profile/gpg_keys`](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/gpg_keys))

- Add your key

  ![gitlab add gpg key](/assets/blogs/setting-up-git/gitlab-add-gpg.png)

</Fragment>

</GitTabs>

- Add our GPG Key to Git.

  Set our primary GPG Signing Key

  ```
  git config --global user.signingkey EDFE9DC0563BE2CF # replace with your gpg key id
  ```

- Optionally, we can also configure Git to make sure we sign on all of our commits by default

  ```
  git config --global commit.gpgsign true
  ```

- Once done, our commits are now verified
